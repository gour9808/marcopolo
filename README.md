## Imports

imports makes the exported declarations of other modules available in the current module.

## Declarations

Declarations are to make directives, components and pipes from the current module available to other directives in the current module.

## Providers

## Modules

A Module declares a compilation context for a set of components, it must declare all the components, directives and pipe it needs.
Every Angular app has a root module.

## Component

Angular components are the basic building blocks of an app, component logic is stored, allow us to define the template, CSS styling, animations.

## Services

logic that isn't associated with a specific view, and that we want to share across components.

## Directives

Responsible for updating the DOM when the state of the model changes 
(1) Structural Directive: change the DOM layout (*ngIf, *ngFor) 
(2) Attibute Directive:  change the behavior of a component (ngStyle)

## Models 

When we are working with Observable we define type of response. We create Models.
